                <p>
                  Anshika, the second child of our trustee Mr. Pankaj, was born a happy and smiling baby.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When she was just 2 years old, her parents discovered that she had a hearing disability. The news came as a shock — their world stopped for a moment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Doctors advised that an urgent ear operation was needed, costing around ₹8–15 lakhs, a huge amount for the family.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Pankaj tried everything — he approached hospitals, applied for government schemes, and sought support for over a year and a half. Unfortunately, no help came.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the end, Pankaj and his wife decided to sell her jewelry to arrange the money for Anshika&apos;s operation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally, after months of struggle, the operation was successful.

                    The day Anshika heard her father&apos;s voice for the first time, tears of joy rolled down his cheeks — and that moment changed everything.

                <p className="font-semibold text-primary text-lg mt-6">
